# Meridian Mobile

Native **Swift and Kotlin** payment clients, plus a clearly labelled browser companion for the connected rehearsal. They use [meridian-api](https://github.com/org-beaconstone/meridian-api) and share state with [meridian-web](https://github.com/org-beaconstone/meridian-web) using `X-Rehearsal-Session`.

## Run the whole rehearsal

Check out all three repos as siblings. From `meridian-api`, run:

```sh
node scripts/rehearsal.mjs
```

Web opens at port 5175, mobile browser companion at 5176, Java API at 8080. All use room `meridian-rehearsal`. Configurable ports and Docker Compose are documented in the API repo. The browser companion is **not a native binary**.

## Swift SDK and native SwiftUI

```sh
cd ios
swift build
swift run MeridianSDKChecks
swift run MeridianDesktop
# Against a running Java API:
MERIDIAN_TEST_API=http://127.0.0.1:8080/api/v1 swift run MeridianLiveChecks
```

The Swift package builds the SDK, the SwiftUI desktop executable, and MeridianSDKChecks (24 assertions). A previous macOS run verified compilation and real Java transport, including payment, duplicate-key retry, pending response, and reset. Native desktop interactions were not UI-automated, and no iOS simulator or device build was run.

For an iOS project, install Xcode and XcodeGen, then `cd ios && xcodegen generate`. `project.yml` builds `App/MeridianApp.swift` with the local SDK package. No iOS simulator/device build was run on the authoring machine because full Xcode was unavailable. Local network HTTP is for the rehearsal only; use HTTPS for any shared hosted endpoint.

## Kotlin SDK and Android Compose

```sh
cd android
mvn clean verify
# With Android Studio / SDK API34 and Gradle8.2.1:
gradle :app:assembleDebug
```

`android/sdk` is the single Kotlin source tree, used by both Maven and Gradle build definitions. Maven compilation was verified; the Android Gradle build was not run locally. Maven executes 26 tests including an actual local HTTP transport check for session/idempotency headers and HTTP202 pending behavior. `LiveChecksKt` also passed against the real Spring Boot API (bank payment, duplicate key, pending and reset). `android/app` contains the native Compose customer UI. No APK or Android device build was verified locally because Android SDK was unavailable.

Android emulator base URL: `http://10.0.2.2:8080/api/v1`. iOS simulator/macOS: `http://127.0.0.1:8080/api/v1`. Configure the same room as the web client. Release Android manifest disallows cleartext; debug enables it for local rehearsal.

## Deliberate baseline

The checkout payment picker is a modal bottom sheet in SwiftUI and Jetpack Compose. Options come from the catalog response and still only offer the baseline pairing: Adyen for card and Worldpay for bank. Any other catalog provider is ignored. While the catalog request is in flight, the selector shows animated skeleton cards. A rail marked degraded, unavailable, or offline shows "This payment method is temporarily unavailable in your region." and cannot be selected. The client does not switch to the other provider when a rail is offline or a payment times out. The browser companion rehearses the same sheet and is not a native binary. No real provider calls, account credentials, SCA, or production authentication exist here. A room ID is a synthetic-data partition, not a security boundary.
